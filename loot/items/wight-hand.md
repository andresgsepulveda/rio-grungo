# Wight Hand

* **Dropped By:** Wight

Acts as an improvised melee weapon that deals 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit. A creature struck by the attck must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. 

The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
