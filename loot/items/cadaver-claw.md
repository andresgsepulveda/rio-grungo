# Cadaver Claw

* **Dropped By:** Cadaver

Acts as a dagger. When it successfully hits a creature other than an elf or undead, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once the claw has been used this way (whether or not the creature was successfully paralyzed) it loses this property.
