# Beacon

*Wonderous item, ???*

This dodecahedron of faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears. It pulsates and thrums when touched.

Mahli noted that this beacon was once an artifact belonging to the Yuan-ti of Krezent. Legends say that it allows people to retain their memories after death.

Focusing on this beacon in the Boneyard granted a Fragment of Possibility. 

## Fragment of Possibility

It looks like a Tiny, grayish bead of energy that follows the creature around, staying within 1 foot of it at all times. The fragment lasts for 8 hours or until used.

When a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it can expend its fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can expend its fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

Currently in the possession of **Grunko Pop Figurr**.

  ## Additional Info
  
  A creature that touches the beacon and concentrates for 1 minute receives a Fragment of Possibility. Once the beacon grants a Fragment of Possibility, it can’t grant another until the next dawn. A creature with a Fragment of Possibility from a Luxon beacon can’t gain another Fragment of Possibility from any source.

  ## Soul Snare
  
  If an attuned creature who has undergone a ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of the beacon, their soul is ensnared by it. This soul will be reincarnated within the body of a random humanoid baby developing within 100 miles of the beacon. The soul retains its memories it had before death.
