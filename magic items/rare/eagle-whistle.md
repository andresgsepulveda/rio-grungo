# Eagle Whistle

*Wonderous Item, Rare*

While you blow an eagle whistle continously, you can fly twice as faast as your walking speed. You can blow the whistle continously for a number of rounds equal to 5 + 5 x your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round) or until you talk, hold your breath, or start suffocating. A use of the whistle also ends if you land. If you are aloft when you stop blowing the whistle, you fall. The whistle has three uses. It regains expended uses daily at dawn.
