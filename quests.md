## A Bargain with White Tusks

* Client: People of Gravesford
* Turn-in: Gravesford

Pinna, the local hedge mage, has been abducted by the White Tusk Clan of Orcs. Taos volunteered the party to take point and resolve the issue before things get worse. 

## Beacon of Hope

* Client: Orimos, Archbearer of Pale Fire
* Turn-in: Krezent

The shulassakar of Krezent seek to reclaim their beacons, that of which can rebirth someone in a new body and restore the memories of that soul. Grunko has bound himself to one of the beacons, so now Orimos has charged him and Mahli with securing more. 

Orimos mentioned coming back to Krezent once three (3) beacons were obtained.

**Beacons:** 1 / 10
1. The Boneyard - This beacon was obtained in a cadaver-infested crypt in the Boneyard. 

## The Crabbiest Catch

* Client: Halfling Man
* Turn-in: Wandering Inn

A halfling man claimed to give a reward of 10 platinum bars (i.e. 1000 pp) to the hunters who could defeat a Daimyo Hermitaur and bring back evidence. 

The party succeeded in defeating the Daimyo Hermitaur, but now there's the matter of finding the Wandering Inn again..
