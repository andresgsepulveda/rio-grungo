These long, red thorn-encrusted vines can stretch up to 3 feet long and have sharp thorns that reach up to two inches long. It isn't rare to find blood stains amongst these vines as many animals and adventurers can easily trip to get caught in a bushel. The vines also seem to exhibit sentient quality as they relax when prey is near, and contract when capturing.
