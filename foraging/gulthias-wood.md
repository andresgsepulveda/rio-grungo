# Gulthias 

* **Found In:** The Boneyard

This spongy, black wood comes from lands blighted by death and malice. 

## Effect(s)

A weapon made of Gulthias wood gains the *Gulthias* tag. The weapon starts with 1d10 charges and gains 1d4 of its expended charges daily at dusk. The weapon is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance, and requires attunment. The weapon additionally gains the following effects:

* **Friend of Fiendish Flora**: Once you are attuned, blights and other evil plant creatures do not regard you as hostile until you harm them.
* **Unsettling Aura**: Beasts, unless accustomed to you, are uncomfortable around you. 
* **Parasitic**: On a successful attack, you can expend one (1) charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by this weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the weapon's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom Saving Throw or gain an effect from the Short Term Madness table.
