# Character Concept

* **Player:** Alpha "gaming" Rave
* **Setting:** Eberron

NOTE: All of this is a work in progress. Things can, and should, change when needed.

DO NOT FEEL PRESSURED TO TAKE MY SUGGESTIONS AND RUN WITH THEM! I am just giving my thoughts as DM of what could work, if you want to mix things up and go a different path, I support you 100%.

## Ideas

This character is a Warforged Redemption Paladin. Name (I think) is still up in the air.

### Key Points

* The current year is 999 YK (Year of the Kingdom of Galifar).
* You are a warforged, created as a servant to the Church of the Silver Flame. Warforged are built to serve their directives, as close to it as possible. 
* You are currently in service of Sir Pelliton, a Knight-Lieutenant of the Silver Flame, and they have dragged a company's worth of templars to the Talenta Plains to reclaim a lost mission, that of which is now known as Gravesford.
* You are aware there is a Silver Flame sect in the area, the Argent Dream, that was made aware of a vampire roaming the plains like he owned the place. Evil must be defeated at all costs.
* You love taking care of people. You're a gentle soul that values life and the beauty it brings. The last thing you would want is take that away from innocent people. 

You can find clarifying info and more on these topics down below, I just thought to summarize up here to make things easier to digest :)

### Archetype 

You, as a Warforged Redemption Paladin, tend to primarily fit the Commando (`COM`) and Defender (`DEF`) roles in the party. You can do a lot of damage and take a lot of it too. Paladin is in general a very versatile class, as you have plenty of healing (`MED`) and support/debuff (`SYN/SAB`) spells to use. The only thing you suck at is actual spells, most of the ones you use enable your `COM` or `DEF` role more than anything else.

### Warforged

The warforged are a relatively new race being created by House Cannith during the Last War in 965 YK (about 40+ years ago?) for the purposes of warfare. The Warforged are sentient constructs and have free will, which earned them the same rights as human citizens in each of their homelands in 996 YK (about 3 years ago) under the Treaty of Thronehold.

Warforged can have unique personality traits though, being constructs, they are restricted in some ways. They experience anger, pain, fear and hatred like their human creators; not all warforged are incredibly reserved and pensive, hiding an array of emotions behind their metallic face. Their faces were not designed to display facial expressions and so it can seem like they are distant to the conversation. Despite their lack of physical facial expressions they're not completely without them as their eyes tend to brighten when experiencing strong or specific emotions.

Warforged often have little life experience as they spent most of their time assigned to one specific duty, usually soldiering. If there is one interest all warforged share it is the love of working and many create endless lists of goals and chores. They take pride in their work and work incredibly hard which makes them dislike idleness and failure. Warforged can excel at most tasks having a single-minded efficiency, especially in combat related roles.[7]

War and military conditioning create the foundation of warforged personalities, they understand duty, the chain of command and conflict. Warforged are typically sexless in body shape, so some do not bother with the concept of gender, while others adopt a gender identity. Warforged were given numerical designations as part of their manufacture and military service, but most adopt new names. Often warforged simply accept the nicknames given to them by their comrades while others seek to earn more meaningful names that best describe them.

### Talenta Plains

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28820236/133868348-1aa1600b-7449-4dd3-861f-aa1424f6875e.png)

The Talenta Plains are a vast grassland stretching from the Blade Desert to the borders of Karrnath and the Mournland. It is the home of wandering herds of buffalo-sized dinosaurs and tribal halflings remaining true to their ancient nomadic way of life since the days before humans walked the lands of Khorvaire. n enormous stretch of pristine grasslands and rolling hills that fade slowly into the wastes of the Blade Desert, the Talenta Plains remain largely untouched by the spread of civilization. Although military trains and the lightning rail wend their way across the grasses, the bulk of the nation remains as it was since before the empire of Galifar was born.

#### Notable Locations

With the exception of Gatherhold, the Talenta Plains boast no permanent settlements. Halfling tribal villages move with the seasons or with wandering game, and although treaty permits Karrnath to keep fortresses along the borders, even those settlements move at least once every few years.
    
* **The Boneyard:** The halflings consider this region of the Blade Desert to be cursed, and they prevent all entities that are not draconic from entering. The region is replete with dragon bones, jutting like dying trees from the desolate earth.
* **Gatherhold:** Built along the coast of Lake Cyre, Gatherhold is the largest Talenta community, but its population is modest at best. The Tribal Council meets at least three times a year to decide matters that affect all Talentan clans, and during these times the city’s population swells to several thousand. Gatherhold is also the heart of House Ghallanda, which keeps several hundred members here even between council gatherings.
* **Gravesford:** A former Silver Flame mission now turned into a small settlement on the Talenta Plains. Gravesford is a melting pot of different races wanting to stake claim out in Talenta. Most people barely know it's there, beyond the residents and the Silver Flame. 
* **Krezent:** Perhaps the only surviving structure on the face of Eberron constructed by the ancient couatls, Krezent has since been claimed and occupied by a tribe of yuan-ti..
* **The Wandering Inn:** An enormous traveling fair and market, the Wandering Inn is House Ghallanda’s means of providing services and news to the roving half ling tribes. Its brightly hued tents appear overnight, ripple in the breeze for a few days, and then vanish as swiftly as they appeared.

#### Common Knowledge

Although recognized as a sovereign nation by the Treaty of Thronehold, the Talenta Plains lack any sort of traditional governing body. The halflings of the region live as they have for thousands of years—in small nomadic clans, traveling about the grasslands as they hunt, gather, trade, and occasionally skirmish with one another. A chieftain called a lath, who is elected by every adult member of the family, leads each tribe. Other than the lath, adult members of a tribe are considered equals.
    
The tribes wander fixed ranges, settling on occasion in tent villages for a few weeks before moving on. Each of the clans keeps herds of dinosaurs as mounts, beasts of burden, and food animals. The bond between a halfling and her dinosaur mount or companion is a sacred one, and the tribesfolk consider the dinosaurs invaluable parts of their families.

### Church of the Silver Flame

The Church of the Silver Flame is the state religion of Thrane. The followers of the religion are called the Purified. 

The Church of the Silver Flame was founded in the early centuries of the Kingdom of Galifar by the sacrifice of a brave paladin, Tira Miron. The church's influence spread throughout the centuries, but its heart remained in Thrane. During the Last War, King Thalin declared independence in the name of spreading worship. When Thalin died, the Church stepped in to replace the monarchy with a theocracy. 

At its core, the Silver Flame is an active religion that calls upon the faithful to fight evil. For the warriors of the church, this means combating the many supernatural threats present in Eberron like undead and fiends. For the ministers and friars of the church, this means leading others to be more compassionate. And for the laity, this means simply living a virtuous life. Beliefs include: 

* The Silver Flame is force of light that holds fiends at bay. Those who seek to defend the innocent from evil can draw on the power of the Flame.
* Every mortal soul can find the light. Inspire and guide others to virtuous behavior; force is a last resort.
* Listen to the Voice of the Flame; beware the deceiving whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.

#### Hierarchy of Evil

The Purified sort evil into five categories

* **Entities of alien evil.** Fiends and aberrations fall into this category, as both malevolent and foreign. While the Gatekeepers are the primary group in Khorvaire concerned with aberrations, a templar of the silver flame would absolutely recognize the threat as important.
* **Entities of unnatural evil.** Undead and lycanthropes are originally of Eberron, but fundamentally corrupted by malevolent forces.
* **Entities of innate evil.** A controversial category, this covers "monsters" like medusas, yuan-ti, and hags. These beliefs have long led to conflict between the church and the natives of Droaam.
* **Those who choose evil.** Evil humanoids are covered by this. Only the most zealous followers believe all evil humanoids must be put to the sword - the church broadly espouses ideals of mercy and repentance for those who choose evil.
* **The evil within.** The time of two keepers has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant for the whispers of the Shadow in the Flame, which seek to mislead and corrupt the purified.

In 992 YK, Keeper Lavina Tagor called for the church to reevaluate the classification of "innate evil" and make individual evaluations for creatures historically hunted by the church. This issue is still under consideration to this day. As you might imagine, it is a contentious topic that leads to a fundamentally lawful good religion to be skewed in all different directions based on interpretation. 

### Thrane 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28820236/133664617-27a380b4-bcd6-448a-b3c0-55b7afd11860.png)

Thrane is one of the original Five Nations that formed the Kingdom of Galifar before The Last War. It is the only nation out of the Five Nations that has replaced its monarchy with a theocracy. Unlike the other nations which largely worship the Sovereign Host religion, Thrane's state religion is the Church of the Silver Flame. 

Thrane is located in central Khorvaire, sharing its western border with Aundair and its southern one by Breland. It also shares a small land border with the Mournland in the south-east, though it is largely separated from the Mournland by the Scions Sound, which forms nearly all of Thrane's east coast and also separates it from the nation of Karrnath. Thrane's long coastline on the Scion's Sound gives it close proximity to Thronehold. Thrane occupies a rich territory of fertile farmland and large forests. What is now northern Thrane was historically a core part of Aundair, most notably Thaliost, the former Aundairian capitol. 

Thranes are overwhelmingly honest and passionate about their state religion The Church of the Silver Flame. Thranish culture is conservative in that the Thranish are devoted to religion, family, work and puritanical ideals. Thranes are known to be hard working, once accepting a task they devote themselves to its completion. The Thranish tend to lead abstinent lives, gambling, carousing and similar hedonistic activities are frowned upon. 

Despite common belief, the majority of Thranes are not zealots and tolerate other belief systems because most are aware that Tira Miron herself started as a paladin of Dol Arrah. The Thranish understand that The Silver Flame demands its followers only destroy evil incarnate in the forms of the undead, fiends and other abominations. If a paladin sensed the evil within a person they would council them back to the light and as a rule would not attempt to execute them. However, on some extreme occasions this has been too hard a set of ideals to follow.
