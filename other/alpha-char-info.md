# Character Concept

* **Player:** Alpha "gaming" Rave
* **Setting:** Eberron

NOTE: All of this is a work in progress. Things can, and should, change when needed.

## Ideas

This character is a `subrace` dwarf, `subclass` paladin of the `Silver Flame`.

### Things to Keep in Mind

* What kind of dwarf are you?
  * Most of the dwarves in the world are of the Hill or Mountain Variety, with a couple of exceptions
  * Being a duergar (i.e. Grey Dwarf, underground) will be a pain in the bitch without some sort of sunlight mitigation. I have ruled sunglasses being magic items to make playing one of them a lot less awful, but then again the abilities of duergar may not be something you're intere
  * Mark of Warding dwarves (i.e. DRAGONMARKS!) are commonplace and have a lot of abilities that mesh well with Paladin (mainly spells like Arcane Lock, Armor of Agathys, and other abjuration abilities). You just have to think about whether or not your character has affiliation with their dragonmarked house at all.

* Where is your character from?
  * Dwarves are primarily from the Mror Holds, but your character can be from anywhere with enough thought put into it. The Last War displaced a lot of people, and the Five Kingdoms tend to have the usual human/elf/halfling/dwarf majority of population.
  * The campaign is taking place in the Talenta Plains, so it's equal parts interesting if you are (or aren't?) from there in the first place. Talenta is like 80-90% halflings in nomadic tribes, so you'd be sort of strange to them (albeit around the same height lmao)
 
* Why are they a paladin of the Silver Flame?
  * Dwarves are primarily worshippers of the Sovereign Host (pantheon, basically). The Church of the Silver Flame is certainly spread somewhat, but depending on your characters origin it may be a stretch. The Sovereign Host and the Silver Flame are not by any means opposing ideologies, it is just societally uncommon to have a dwarf that doesn't hold Kol Korran (Sovereign of Wealth) in high regard. 
  * SUGGESTION: You could be originally from Flamekeep in Thrane, the seat of the Church of the Silver Flame and the source of their power. Thrane is one of the Five Kingdoms and a theocracy, so it makes sense that being from there would lead to your involvement. Otherwise, any place definitely works, i'm just thinking of paths with little resistance, so to speak.

* Why are you in the Talenta Plains?
  * Currently, the party is exploring near a settlement called Gravesford. It was originally a Silver Flame mission that has since been repurposed following their abandonment of the people living there. Now it's a small but potent melting pot of all kinds, a farcry comparative to the halfling tribes that roam the area. There is a contingent of the Silver Flame led by Sir Pelliton that is ~~terrorizing these poor settlers~~ reclaiming rightful Silver Flame territory and ~~marginalizing natives~~ fending off the bestial White Tusk Clan of Orcs in the area. They [Silver Flame] have a castle that was ~~moved into since it was fucking empty for litreally years?!~~ stolen by the White Tusks that they want back.
 
* Why would you join the party?
  * The party is a Grung (i.e. frogman) treasure hunter, a normal looking cowboy, and a native shulassakar yuan-ti dedicated to 'The Pale Fire'. What business would a Silver Flame paladin even want with a party like that?
  * SUGGESTION: I really dig your idea of defecting, since Sir Pelliton is an asshole (among other more nefarious things...). However, I imagine that would be something a little more eventful than 'you are fired, pack your bags mate'.
  * SUGGESTION: Maybe the party could encounter Silver Flame paladins that attack them, with you being one of them? Chances are you were given orders to take them out (reasoning for that will make sense the more you learn about a certain member of the party...). After realizing that these are just people trying to live their lives, you could decide mid combat that this is not right (or really up to Silver Flame code..) and turn on them. I think it would make for an interesting experience, especially having PvP turn into PvE before things get antagonistic. 

You can find clarifying info down below, I just thought to summarize up here to make things easier to digest :)

## Relevant Information

### Dwarves

In Eberron, dwarves are one of the 'common' races alongside humans, halflings, elves, etc. Although a vast majority of them live in the **Mror Holds**, plenty of them live everywhere to the point where nobody considers them strange. 

Dwarves are one of the few races that manifest non-aberrant dragonmarks, specifically manifesting the Mark of Warding (abjuration-type abilities that focus around locking things down). Certainly, your character can be any subrace of dwarf available in published D&D 5E, however the stats of that are available below.

#### The Mror Holds

The Mror Holds are known as the homeland of the dwarves. Hemmed in by the Ironroot Mountains and the Hoarfrost Mountains on both sides and the Bitter Sea to the northwest much of the establishments of the Mror Holds are located underground. To the east are the Lhazaar Principalities while the Talenta Plains and Karrnath share its western border. 

Over the past millennium, the Sovereign Host has built up a strong presence within the Holds. Kol Koran, the Lord of World and Wealth, commands the most followers, but Boldrei, Olladar, Onatar, and Dol Dorn also receive worship.

#### House Kundarak and the Mark of Warding

House Kundarak is a Dwarven house with services focused in security and banking. Their primary customers are those who have enough coin to buy something worth protecting including the wealthy, the powerful, other dragon marked houses and even state governments. They are the wealthiest Dragonmarked House by far and their banking establishments can be found all over Khorvaire.

### Church of the Silver Flame

The Church of the Silver Flame is the state religion of Thrane. The followers of the religion are called the Purified. 

The Church of the Silver Flame was founded in the early centuries of the Kingdom of Galifar by the sacrifice of a brave paladin, Tira Miron. The church's influence spread throughout the centuries, but its heart remained in Thrane. During the Last War, King Thalin declared independence in the name of spreading worship. When Thalin died, the Church stepped in to replace the monarchy with a theocracy. 

At its core, the Silver Flame is an active religion that calls upon the faithful to fight evil. For the warriors of the church, this means combating the many supernatural threats present in Eberron like undead and fiends. For the ministers and friars of the church, this means leading others to be more compassionate. And for the laity, this means simply living a virtuous life. Beliefs include: 

* The Silver Flame is force of light that holds fiends at bay. Those who seek to defend the innocent from evil can draw on the power of the Flame.
* Every mortal soul can find the light. Inspire and guide others to virtuous behavior; force is a last resort.
* Listen to the Voice of the Flame; beware the deceiving whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.

#### Hierarchy of Evil

The Purified sort evil into five categories

* **Entities of alien evil.** Fiends and aberrations fall into this category, as both malevolent and foreign. While the Gatekeepers are the primary group in Khorvaire concerned with aberrations, a templar of the silver flame would absolutely recognize the threat as important.
* **Entities of unnatural evil.** Undead and lycanthropes are originally of Eberron, but fundamentally corrupted by malevolent forces.
* **Entities of innate evil.** A controversial category, this covers "monsters" like medusas, yuan-ti, and hags. These beliefs have long led to conflict between the church and the natives of Droaam.
* **Those who choose evil.** Evil humanoids are covered by this. Only the most zealous followers believe all evil humanoids must be put to the sword - the church broadly espouses ideals of mercy and repentance for those who choose evil.
* **The evil within.** The time of two keepers has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant for the whispers of the Shadow in the Flame, which seek to mislead and corrupt the purified.

In 992 YK, Keeper Lavina Tagor called for the church to reevaluate the classification of "innate evil" and make individual evaluations for creatures historically hunted by the church. This issue is still under consideration to this day. As you might imagine, it is a contentious topic that leads to a fundamentally lawful good religion to be skewed in all different directions based on interpretation.
