NOTE: All of this is a work in progress. Things can, and should, change when needed.

DO NOT FEEL PRESSURED TO TAKE MY SUGGESTIONS AND RUN WITH THEM! I am just giving my thoughts as DM of what could work, if you want to mix things up and go a different path, I support you 100%.

The Church of the Silver Flame is the state religion of Thrane. The followers of the religion are called the Purified. 

The Church of the Silver Flame was founded in the early centuries of the Kingdom of Galifar by the sacrifice of a brave paladin, Tira Miron. The church's influence spread throughout the centuries, but its heart remained in Thrane. During the Last War, King Thalin declared independence in the name of spreading worship. When Thalin died, the Church stepped in to replace the monarchy with a theocracy. 

At its core, the Silver Flame is an active religion that calls upon the faithful to fight evil. For the warriors of the church, this means combating the many supernatural threats present in Eberron like undead and fiends. For the ministers and friars of the church, this means leading others to be more compassionate. And for the laity, this means simply living a virtuous life. Beliefs include: 

* The Silver Flame is force of light that holds fiends at bay. Those who seek to defend the innocent from evil can draw on the power of the Flame.
* Every mortal soul can find the light. Inspire and guide others to virtuous behavior; force is a last resort.
* Listen to the Voice of the Flame; beware the deceiving whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.

#### Hierarchy of Evil

The Purified sort evil into five categories

* **Entities of alien evil.** Fiends and aberrations fall into this category, as both malevolent and foreign. While the Gatekeepers are the primary group in Khorvaire concerned with aberrations, a templar of the silver flame would absolutely recognize the threat as important.
* **Entities of unnatural evil.** Undead and lycanthropes are originally of Eberron, but fundamentally corrupted by malevolent forces.
* **Entities of innate evil.** A controversial category, this covers "monsters" like medusas, yuan-ti, and hags. These beliefs have long led to conflict between the church and the natives of Droaam.
* **Those who choose evil.** Evil humanoids are covered by this. Only the most zealous followers believe all evil humanoids must be put to the sword - the church broadly espouses ideals of mercy and repentance for those who choose evil.
* **The evil within.** The time of two keepers has highlighted the importance of staying vigilant for the whispers of the Shadow in the Flame, which seek to mislead and corrupt the purified.

In 992 YK, Keeper Lavina Tagor called for the church to reevaluate the classification of "innate evil" and make individual evaluations for creatures historically hunted by the church. This issue is still under consideration to this day. As you might imagine, it is a contentious topic that leads to a fundamentally lawful good religion to be skewed in all different directions based on interpretation. 

### Thrane

Thrane is one of the original Five Nations that formed the Kingdom of Galifar before The Last War. It is the only nation out of the Five Nations that has replaced its monarchy with a theocracy. Unlike the other nations which largely worship the Sovereign Host religion, Thrane's state religion is the Church of the Silver Flame. 

Thrane is located in central Khorvaire, sharing its western border with Aundair and its southern one by Breland. It also shares a small land border with the Mournland in the south-east, though it is largely separated from the Mournland by the Scions Sound, which forms nearly all of Thrane's east coast and also separates it from the nation of Karrnath. Thrane's long coastline on the Scion's Sound gives it close proximity to Thronehold. Thrane occupies a rich territory of fertile farmland and large forests. What is now northern Thrane was historically a core part of Aundair, most notably Thaliost, the former Aundairian capitol. 

Thranes are overwhelmingly honest and passionate about their state religion The Church of the Silver Flame. Thranish culture is conservative in that the Thranish are devoted to religion, family, work and puritanical ideals. Thranes are known to be hard working, once accepting a task they devote themselves to its completion. The Thranish tend to lead abstinent lives, gambling, carousing and similar hedonistic activities are frowned upon. 

Despite common belief, the majority of Thranes are not zealots and tolerate other belief systems because most are aware that Tira Miron herself started as a paladin of Dol Arrah. The Thranish understand that The Silver Flame demands its followers only destroy evil incarnate in the forms of the undead, fiends and other abominations. If a paladin sensed the evil within a person they would council them back to the light and as a rule would not attempt to execute them. However, on some extreme occasions this has been too hard a set of ideals to follow.
